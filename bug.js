This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has fully mounted.  This often happens inside the component's constructor or before the componentDidMount lifecycle method is called.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Potential error here
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
